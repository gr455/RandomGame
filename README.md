# RandomGame
A single-player Game involving random numbers
This game allows you to select a number>0 and then you must try to guess what the computer has selected out of random in that range. A real time-killer.


This is the BASE version of it, and it's complexity is very minimal.
Expansion plans include:
1. A leaderboard(through file operations; creating a leaderboard file and appending scores and names to it)
2. A new system for scoring(score=<total number of correct guesses> * <max_integer>/(<number of tries>)
3. A much better user interface(Buttons,colours,Help section?)
  
Suggestions/Pull requests encouraged(needed)
