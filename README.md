# RandomGame
A single-player Game involving random numbers
This game allows you to select a number>0 and then you must try to guess what the computer has selected out of random in that range. A real time-killer.


This is the BASE version of it, and it's complexity is very minimal.
Expansion plans include:
1. A leaderboard(through file operations; creating a leaderboard file and appending scores and names to it)
2. A much better user interface(Buttons,colours,Help section?)
3. A GitHub website for playing the game online
  
Suggestions/Pull requests encouraged(needed)
